# Materials detection model
For my project at BSE, I wanted to create an AI model which can identify various materials from an input image. While there are already models that can detect objects, I have not seen any that can detect the specific materials used on the object. This has applications from better self-driving cars software, to helping the blind "see," in more vivid detail.

This is the raspberry pi that the final AI model will run on.
# Final Milestone
My final milestone is to implement my model to an Android app, so that a user can detect materials with the click of one button.

# Second Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up my raspberry pi and preparing it so that it would be able to run the model after it had been trained. Of greater accomplishment was the creation of my dataset, which was done by combining several datasets together. I replaced their labels and prepared them to be used for training. Training could not be done on the actual pi because of its limited processing power. Therefore, I used Google Colab which allowed me to quickly train my model on a powerful gpu.The accuracy of my first prototype model was around 94%.
